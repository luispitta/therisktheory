## Model

Let `N` be the number of claims in a period and `X_1, X_2, ...` the claim amounts. The
aggregate claims are `S = X_1 + ... + X_N`, with `S = 0` when there are no claims. As in the
collective model of Section 3.1 (p. 41), the claim amounts are i.i.d. like some `X`, and `N` is
independent of them. We also need `E[N]` and `E[X]` to be finite. Nothing else is assumed about
the distributions.

## Expected aggregate claims

`E[S] = E[N] E[X]`.

Given `N = n` the sum has `n` terms. Since `N` is independent of the claim amounts, the
condition can be dropped, and by linearity `E[S | N = n] = n E[X]`. So `E[S | N] = N E[X]`, and
by the law of total expectation `E[S] = E[N E[X]] = E[N] E[X]`. This is eq. (3.3) on p. 42, where
it is written as `E[S] = μ1 E[N]` with `μ1 = E[X]`.

Two checks are in `tests/test_premiums.py`. One lists every outcome of a small model and gets
126 = 0.7 × 180. The other simulates a compound Poisson(3) model with exponential claims of
mean 200 and compares the sample mean with 600.

## Pure premium

The pure (net) premium is `P = E[S]`. The book calls it the net premium or equivalence principle
(Section 5.3, p. 119). It balances the expected claims and nothing more, and the book points out
that a premium without a positive loading leads to ruin with certainty (p. 120). That is why the
loaded premiums in the rest of Topic 1 are needed.

## Expected value principle

`π[S] = (1 + θ) E[S]`, principle (b) on p. 119. The book takes `θ > 0`; the function also accepts
`θ = 0`, which gives back the pure premium.

From Section 5.3.1 and Table 5.1 (pp. 120–122), for `θ > 0`:

- The loading is non-negative, since `π[S] − E[S] = θ E[S] ≥ 0`.
- It is additive, by linearity of the expectation.
- It is proportional, `π[cS] = c π[S]` (Example 5.3.2, p. 121).
- It can charge more than the maximum loss: for a constant risk `c > 0` the premium is
  `(1 + θ)c`.
- It is not consistent, because `π[S + c] = π[S] + (1 + θ)c`.
- It is not iterative, because applying it twice gives `(1 + θ)² E[S]`.

The main weakness is that the loading only depends on the mean, so two risks with the same mean
and very different variances pay the same premium. The variance and standard deviation
principles (also on p. 119) deal with that.
